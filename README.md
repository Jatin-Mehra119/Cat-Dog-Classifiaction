[Cat/Dog Classifier APP](https://cat-dog-clf.streamlit.app/)

This repository contains a deep learning-based image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and the app is deployed using Streamlit for easy interaction.

## Model Training

The model is trained using transfer learning. It uses MobileNetV2 as the base model with pre-trained weights from ImageNet. The final dense layers are added for binary classification. The model is then fine-tuned to enhance its accuracy.

## Training Script

The training code (provided separately) includes:

-   Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
-   Building a CNN using MobileNetV2.
-   Applying data augmentation to improve generalization.
-   Fine-tuning the model to boost performance.


## Deployment

The repository includes an `app.py` script to deploy the model using **Streamlit**. The app allows users to upload an image of a cat or a dog, and it returns the predicted class.
